A todo list application written in C#

v1.0.1 (10/08/18): General bug fixes and improvements, documentation.

v1.0.2 (10/22/18): Changes to how current day's events are determined. This build was forgotten and was rediscovered on 06/21/20. It's probably cursed or something, I have no memory of making it.
